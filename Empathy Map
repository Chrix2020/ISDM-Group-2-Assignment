#Empathy Map


Throughout analysing the perspectives from both the customer and Relationship Manager, it is evident that an ideal solution can be addressed
regarding the needs and concerns of the customers within the in-house call management system. 

As a result, these problems delve into not only the satisfaction of the customers, but the personalised service quality of the Relationship 
Managers in being employed to negotiate and comprehensively be well informed and acknowledgeable of a customers selection of a travel 
package. Thus enabling a customer to be convinced with a likelihood for purchase. Also another problem situated with the Relationship
Manager is the exerting pressure of selling and promoting each travel package which emplaces difficulty for the call management center to
target alternative buyers causing an amass amount of unresponsive call turnover times and bottleneck by the volume of calls issued by the
customer.

Therefore, as seen in both Empathy Maps, we can see a formidible strain of concern in addressing the customers needs with the increased
backlog of customer calls, huge turnover times and evidently service copetencie of the Relationship Manager to sustain and eliminate any 
problems regarding to their customers.
