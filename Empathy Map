#Empathy Map


As seen through both emotional perspectives from both the Customer and the Relationship Manager, their incentives are equivilated to the 
concerns of the customers needs which are epitomised through the selection of their holiday packages. As a result, an alternative solution

outbound customers who are assigned to other Relationship Managers to promote their sales on their travel destinations and convince the
customer in their requested purchase to be likely.
