Throughout analysing the perspectives from both the customer and Relationship Manager, it is evident that an ideal solution can be 
addressed regarding the needs and concerns of the customers within the in-house call management system. 

As a result, these problems delve into not only the satisfaction of the customers, but the personalised service quality of the 
Relationship Managers in being employed to negotiate and be well informed and acknowledgeable of a customers selection 
of a travel package. In addition where customers are assigned to an RM based on their profile and their managers service quality has proven to be an operational risk. 

Also another problem situated with the Relationship Manager is the exerting pressure of selling and promoting each travel package, emplacing alternative buyers to be targeted, causing the call management center with a disruption of unresponsive call turnover 
times and bottlenecking throughout the large volume of calls issued by the customers, articulated in their complex operations of
assigning their customers to a reliable and trustworthy RM based on their initial Customer Profiles and Skill Score. 

Therefore, as seen in both Empathy Maps, we can see a formidible strain of concern in addressing the customers needs with the increased
backlog of customer calls, huge turnover times and evidently service competencies of the Relationship Manager to sustain and eliminate any problems regarding to their customers.
