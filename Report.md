### Assumptions
1. Their existing process model is currently proving to be inefficient, where their extensive list of varying holiday package offerings is exerting more pressure on making sales, having a compromise twoards the quality of customer service. With limited or restrictive product knowledge equipped by Relationship Managers in addition, this results in poor customer experience with lack of personalised servicing, call backlogs, long call turnovers, low customer retention and lower sales.


### POV Statements
**Relationship Manager POV Statement**

Relationship Managers within the Call Management Centre for TravelMate need a new re-invented business process system established to maximise the amount of customer calls serviced, improve customer service and increase sales potential of holiday packages, because evidence of low performance from RMs, customer dissatisfaction and low sales have shown to be a costly bsuienss process with no return.

**Customer POV Statement**

Customers interested in purcahsing a holiday package from a travel company need a fast and streamlined process that allows them to enquire available holiday package offerings that suit their travelling wishes from knowledgeable travel agents, because any slight inconvenience in the process, whether be service quality or competency of the agennt, can deter customers from making a purchasing decision.
