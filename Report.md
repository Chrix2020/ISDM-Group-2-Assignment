## **Executive Summary**
A major travel company would like to develop an information system in order to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC). This system will have the ability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM), in order to assist them in creating end-customers. This new system will also have the ability to target potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. The implementation of the new system will enable the business to expand their customer pool, creating more sales as a result, as well as improving the overall calling experience for customers. 

## **1. Problem Definition: Objectives, List of Stakeholders:**
### Objectives
Through the development and implementation of an information system, a major travel company hopes to improve the operation of their in house call management centre (CMC). The business has created a number of objectives which must be met when implementing the new system in order for the new system to function as intended. The first objective is the system's ability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM), so as to assist RMs through matching them to suitable end-customers. Furthermore, the new system will be able to match customers to RMs based on the Rms skills and customer profiles. Another objective is the system's ability to target potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. This will enable the company to expand their pool of potential customers, resulting in more end-customers as a result. Furthermore, during busy times the system will have the capability of directing inbound customers to an Interactive Voice Response Unit which prompts them for options, and may even ask for call reasons in a few words. It will then automatically redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM. This will assist in reducing the number of customers ending the call due to long waiting times.


### Identify Stakeholders
Due to the complexity of the travel companies operations, there are a variety of stakeholders that will micro-manage the in house call management center to consistently accommodate customers with a variety of selection of travel packages issued by their Relationship Manager.  These are:
1. Relationship Managers (RM) who perform sales of holiday packages alongside with other sales or discounts of other travel packages based on customer feedback.
2. End-Customers (potential customers). Customers who are interested in being offered a travel package by their call agent.
3. Automatic Call DistributorsRoutes inbound calls to the first available customer.
  * For outbound callers, System generates a targeted list of customers automatically dialling numbers for each customer to be assigned 
  to a Relationship Manager achieving a similar skill matching score based on their RM Profile and travel package. They are issued with           informative and comprehensive information of the travel destination theyâ€™ve picked.



### Problem Definition
* A major travel company wishes to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC) to service customers much more effectively and increase sales potential for holiday packages sold by Relationship Managers (RM). 

* Their existing process model is currently proving to be inefficient, where their extensive list of varying holiday package offerings is exerting more pressure on making sales, having a compromise towards the quality of customer service. With limited or restrictive product knowledge of Relationship Managers in addition to this, this results in poor customer experience with lack of personalised servicing, call backlogs, long call turnovers, low customer retention and lower sales.

* As such, a new information system designed specifically to automate the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC) must be developed to provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control, for both inbound and outbound calls, and more streamlined process that will directly match Relationship Managers to customers, based on the correlation of RM skills and customer profiles to ensure success in sales and customer service.



### Assumptions
1. Their existing process model is currently proving to be inefficient, where their extensive list of varying holiday package offerings is exerting more pressure on making sales, having a compromise twoards the quality of customer service. With limited or restrictive product knowledge equipped by Relationship Managers in addition, this results in poor customer experience with lack of personalised servicing, call backlogs, long call turnovers, low customer retention and lower sales.


### POV Statements
**Relationship Manager POV Statement**

Relationship Managers within the Call Management Centre for TravelMate need a new re-invented business process system established to maximise the amount of customer calls serviced, improve customer service and increase sales potential of holiday packages, because evidence of low performance from RMs, customer dissatisfaction and low sales have shown to be a costly bsuienss process with no return.

**Customer POV Statement**

Customers interested in purcahsing a holiday package from a travel company need a fast and streamlined process that allows them to enquire available holiday package offerings that suit their travelling wishes from knowledgeable travel agents, because any slight inconvenience in the process, whether be service quality or competency of the agennt, can deter customers from making a purchasing decision.
