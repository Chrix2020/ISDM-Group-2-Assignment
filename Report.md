## **Executive Summary**
A major travel company would like to develop an information system in order to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC). This system will have the ability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM), in order to assist them in creating end-customers. This new system will also have the ability to target potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. The implementation of the new system will enable the business to expand their customer pool, creating more sales as a result, as well as improving the overall calling experience for customers. 

## **1. Problem Definition: Objectives, List of Stakeholders:**
### Objectives
Through the development and implementation of an information system, a major travel company hopes to improve the operation of their in house call management centre (CMC). The business has created a number of objectives which must be met when implementing the new system in order for the new system to function as intended. The first objective is the system's ability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM), so as to assist RMs through matching them to suitable end-customers. Furthermore, the new system will be able to match customers to RMs based on the Rms skills and customer profiles. Another objective is the system's ability to target potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. This will enable the company to expand their pool of potential customers, resulting in more end-customers as a result. Furthermore, during busy times the system will have the capability of directing inbound customers to an Interactive Voice Response Unit which prompts them for options, and may even ask for call reasons in a few words. It will then automatically redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM. This will assist in reducing the number of customers ending the call due to long waiting times.


### Identify Stakeholders
Due to the complexity of the travel companies operations, there are a variety of stakeholders that will micro-manage the in house call management center to consistently accommodate customers with a variety of selection of travel packages issued by their Relationship Manager.  These are:
1. Relationship Managers (RM) who perform sales of holiday packages alongside with other sales or discounts of other travel packages based on customer feedback.
2. End-Customers (potential customers). Customers who are interested in being offered a travel package by their call agent.
3. Automatic Call Distributors routes inbound calls to the first available customer.
  * For outbound callers, System generates a targeted list of customers automatically dialling numbers for each customer to be assigned 
  to a Relationship Manager achieving a similar skill matching score based on their RM Profile and travel package. They are issued with           informative and comprehensive information of the travel destination theyâ€™ve picked.



### Problem Definition
* A major travel company wishes to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC) to service customers much more effectively and increase sales potential for holiday packages sold by Relationship Managers (RM). 

* Their existing process model is currently proving to be inefficient, where their extensive list of varying holiday package offerings is exerting more pressure on making sales, having a compromise towards the quality of customer service. With limited or restrictive product knowledge of Relationship Managers in addition to this, this results in poor customer experience with lack of personalised servicing, call backlogs, long call turnovers, low customer retention and lower sales.

* As such, a new information system designed specifically to automate the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC) must be developed to provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control, for both inbound and outbound calls, and more streamlined process that will directly match Relationship Managers to customers, based on the correlation of RM skills and customer profiles to ensure success in sales and customer service.



### Assumptions
1. Their existing process model is currently proving to be inefficient, where their extensive list of varying holiday package offerings is exerting more pressure on making sales, having a compromise twoards the quality of customer service. With limited or restrictive product knowledge equipped by Relationship Managers in addition, this results in poor customer experience with lack of personalised servicing, call backlogs, long call turnovers, low customer retention and lower sales.


### POV Statements
**Relationship Manager POV Statement**

Relationship Managers within the Call Management Centre for TravelMate need a new re-invented business process system established to maximise the amount of customer calls serviced, improve customer service and increase sales potential of holiday packages, because evidence of low performance from RMs, customer dissatisfaction and low sales have shown to be a costly bsuienss process with no return.

**Customer POV Statement**

Customers interested in purchasing a holiday package from a travel company need a fast and streamlined process that allows them to enquire available holiday package offerings that suit their travelling wishes from knowledgeable travel agents, because any slight inconvenience in the process, whether be service quality or competency of the agennt, can deter customers from making a purchasing decision.

Throughout analysing the perspectives and emotions from both the customer and Relationship Manager, it is evident that an ideal solution can be addressed regarding the needs and concerns of the customers within the in-house call management system. This is in terms articulating the customers concerns regarding the high quality service and service competencies of the RM.

Additionally, a problem that was constrained with the Relationship Manager is the personalised service quality, delivering well informed travel information and are acknowledgable of a customers selection of a travel package. In addition to the service competencies of the RM which customers are assigned to has proven to be an operational risk that can have a possibility in detering a purchasing decision if they're not on board, impacting the overall user satisfaction, increase sales and maintain customer retention.

Another problem that was situated with the Relationship Manager is the exerting pressure of selling and promoting each travel package, targeting other potential buyers with assistance to the system generating a target list for outbound callers, causing the call management center with a disruption of unresponsive call turnover times and bottlenecking throughout the large volume of calls issued by the customers. In addition compromising the overall service quality issued to the customers with no apparent system that can maximize the amount of calls serviced, record sales transactions and assign approriate customers to relative RMS based on their initial customer profiles and Skill Scores impacting the overall integrity of the system, hence putting the system into a massive deadlock.

Therefore, from both Empathy Maps, we can see a formidible strain of concern in addressing the customers needs with the increased
backlog of customer calls, huge turnover times and evidently service competencies of the Relationship Manager to sustain and eliminate any problems regarding to their customers.

### Relationship Manager HMW Statements
* How might we effectively train Relationship Managers to maximze customer retention and improve customer service at a low cost to overall increase sales opportunities?
* How might we improve the ability for Relationship Managers to track impending calls issued by end-customers?
* How might we allow Relationship Managers to market holiday packages to attract other potential buyers as a way to maximise sales?

### Customer HMW Statements
* How might we determine that a customers impending call is routed to the first available travel agent?
* How might we improve the overall process to match customers with suitable Relationship Managers based on RM Skills and customer profiles?
* How might we alert customers if a select holiday package of their choice is available for offering or not?
* How might we survey customers on their opinions of the system in order to improve the overall user experience?
* How might we prevent customers from deterring when making a purchasing decision?
* How might we market other potential holiday packages for potential customers to be fond with a vast selection of offerings?



### Assumption Reflection
An assumption was made to assume that the current business process model is proving to be inefficient. Due to the limitations of the original requirements elicitation in conversation with the travel agency, TravelMate, an assumption of their implemented business process model is rather traditional and analogue, which therefore involves using a collection of systems, instead of one holistic and feature-rich system. These separate systems that would work as part of the process model are assumed to be:
* An individualised customer contact book for each relationship manager to record their clients, either paperback or in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
* A sales transaction processing system to process holiday package purchases made by customers using direct bank transfer.
* An email outbound system to send email confirmations of holiday package purchases to paying customers.

As such, there are limitations with their current business process model. For example, the process of customers phoning in without certainty of being answered, as there is no call queue system in place, thus losing sales opportunities to the business. Furthermore, the systems used in the business process model are disconnected, as the Relationship Managers need to engage with each system individually to execute the business process sequentially. This presents a handicap to the workflow of Relationship Managers as this is rather inefficient compared to having a single automated system that encompasses all separate systems into one holistic application.


### Ideation
<ul>
<li>
<p>The new system will be a holistic new application that will mesh the currently assumed information systems supporting TravelMate&rsquo;s business process all into one, with also new further additions that can compliment the performance of Relationship Managers towards company and sales objectives. The new system will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dashboard to monitor and display customer impending calls</li>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s functionalities include the ability to queue calls and end a customer call.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Each relationship Manager can view a customers impending call and can issue the assigned customers profile to enquire what subsequent problems they&rsquo;ve encountered.</li>
</ul>
<li>A dashboard to list the profiles of Relationship Managers on shift</li>
<ul>
<li>The function of this will allow the call centre floor to acknowledge the performance of these customer service agents by tracking their availability, calls serviced, sales made and comparing them against key performance indicators (KPI&rsquo;s) for the day.</li>
</ul>
<li>Secondary hardware and software will also be included in order to record sales transactions and individualised customer books for relationship managers to keep customer information when requesting for enquiries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

### Product/Sprint Backlog
#### *Sprint Backlog*

Throughout analysing the deficiencies of the proven existing model, the Sprint Backlog was moulded to document the effective project plans and implementation of each product deliverable for the development team. By using the Sprint Backlog as a major instrument in the Agile Approach through SCRUM, it can maximise the success and probability for deployment of the new and improved information system. Thus with the effective planning of progress, implementation and completion of all tasks allows both software and hardware to interact and maintain the feasibility of the new and holistic system.

## **4. Competitive Advantages and Possible Effects If Project fails**

### If the Project succeeds:

#### Competitive Edge/Service Differentiation-
In comparison with other travel companies, TravelMate has offered a better competitive edge on the market due to automation that other competitors have yet to adapt to. With successful testing & implementation of the new holistic system, this offers convenience for existing end-customers, displaying a variety of available travel package offerings alongside with payment options when offered an approved proposed travel product if a purchase is likely. In addition, customers can request calls to suitable Travel Agents (Relationship Managers) to assist with their impending selection of travel purchases allowing the RM to monitor the continious stream of calls using the dashboard reducing overall turnover times and initial costs. This enables Relationship Managers to tailor customers with the best possible choice of travel preferences and offered products measuring the possibility of purchase as a capability to expoentially increase the amount of business sales to efficiently sell more products, potentially maximizing sales opportunities and inviting potential end-customers and buyers in marketing the new application. Therefore, with the success of the new operations gives customers the edge to rely on travel companies like TravelMate to assist with their travelling needs, offering the best travel services and products to continiously improve the overall user call experience and tailor personalised quality service to maintain the longevity of the travel company.


#### Word of Mouth Promotion-
Since the system is primarily human centric, this gives an advantage to other major travel companies a unique approach to assist customers with their travelling needs. Unlike other major travel companies in comparison to TravelMate, customers utilise word of mouth promotion to express a new and holistic approach for travel enquries, inviting potential customers at the norm using a variety of telemarketing methods including online advertising, social media to exhibit the new and refined approach of a customers variety of travel package offerings for their travels. In addition, customers may impose a rating for their assigned Relationship Manager as a convention to share their experiences throughout their services with their travel agent, allowing existing customers utilise other telemarketing strategies in reducing costs to market.
 

### If the project fails:

#### Loss of Customer Satisfaction- 
If the project was to fail, existing and loyal customers may be impacted during the trialling and implementation phase. Customers utilising the holistic application may not have a form of familiarity and have a likelihood to deter away from the new operations for instance, a streamlined dashboard to record sales transaction and track confirmed purchases from a customers preference of travel packages and choice of destination can deter customers away from their purchasing decisions, hence perceiving an inept reputation for the business like TravelMate to improve its system.

#### Adaptability to new Business Operations-
With the premise to improve the overall customer quality service and the automation of the travel companies minimalistic operations in expanding the volume of end-customers with suitable RMs, if the system was implemented during normal business hours with necessary trialling and testing phases would result a detrimental impact to the overall operational feasibility of the system. In addition to the extensive list of problems pinpointed within the current existing model, depicted by the poor relative performance of RMs with restrict product knowledge and the variation of travel package offerings, reverting back to the old and analogue operations can perceive a bad influence for both staff and customers on how the major travel company is supposed to run. Consequently, generating confusion on how the travel company adapts to the refined traditional system. Therefore, without the necessary training for employees and staff can result with discrete knowledge of the new system, deterring customers away from their purchasing decisions resulting in understaffing and low customer retention impacting overall day to day operations causing a backlog in calls, turnover times and generate sales for each successful purchase.

#### Low Customer Retention-
If the project was to fail, customers may deter away from the travel company and seek other alternative markets or travel agents to bargain and assist with their travelling needs. As such, customers may have a tendency to revert back to the old operations if not treated as a valuable guest impacting overall call experience and relationship with the company. With the existing limitations of poor service competencies by the Relationship Managers can overall perceive a negative perception on how the travel company is intended to run, restricting new and existing end customers to be tailored with recommended travel preferences alongside their selection of travel product/s, losing major business sales opportunities. In addition, customers may invest in other purchases with additional travel information and discounts from other competitive markets from a popular choice of package offerings, putting a handicap towards TravelMate's inability to satisfy the needs for their existing customers, turning back their purchasing decisions as a result in complimenting other business performance and sales objectives, thus impacting the companies objectives to maintain personalised customer service and retaining business sales opportunities.
